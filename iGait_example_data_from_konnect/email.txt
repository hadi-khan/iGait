Hi,

Here's the data file I generated. The first row is the header and shows what these numbers represent. The time I put is basically the timestamp calculated using timeval in C++ and is a time offset starting from Jan 1 1970 (You can easily convert it to date time in C++ or just use it as it is)
   I've also attached two files as they appear in the reference column for your tests. Please let me know if you have any questions.
